# ReservationSystemProjectCS2
This is my reservation system. 
It has all of the methods and also uses scanner to add reservations, cancel reservations, and change the party size of reservations. 
The reservations included number of guests, time of reservation, time reservation was made, and party name.
I used an ArrayList to hold all of the reservations and bubble sort to sort the reservations by earliest to latest. 
I used a second ArrayList to hold only the time of reservations for the bubble sort method.
I also used print statements to guide the user through the interface.

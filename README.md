# ReservationSystemProjectCS2
This is my reservation system. 
It has all of the methods and also uses scanner to add reservations, cancel reservations, and change the party size of reservations. 
I used an ArrayList to hold all of the reservations and bubble sort to sort the reservations by earliest to latest. 
I also used print statements to guide the user through the interface.
